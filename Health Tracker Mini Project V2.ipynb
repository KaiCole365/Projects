        "#### This is an update to an earlier version of the project (Health Tracker Mini Project V1.ipynb). The reason for the update was to make it easier for the user to calculate their BMR. Initially, I had to do the calculations on my own and enter my BMR when prompted by the program. This was quite tedious and made more sense to update the code with both male and female calculations for BMR."
